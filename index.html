            <p><b><h2>Hummingbird </h2> , any of about 320 species of small, often brightly coloured birds of the family Trochilidae, usually placed with the swifts in the order Apodiformes but sometimes separated in their own order, Trochiliformes. The brilliant, glittering colours and elaborately specialized feathers of many species (usually of the males only) led the 19th-century British naturalist John Gould to give many hummingbirds exotic common names, many of which are still in use—e.g., coquette, fairy, hill star, wood star, sapphire, topaz, sun gem, and sylph.

                Hummingbirds are restricted in distribution to the New World, where the greatest variety and number of species occur in South America. About 12 species are found regularly in the United States and Canada. Only the ruby-throated hummingbird (Archilochus colubris) breeds in eastern North America, where it is found from Nova Scotia to Florida. The northernmost hummingbird is the rufous (Selasphorus rufus), which breeds from southeastern Alaska to northern California. The broad-tailed hummingbird (S. platycercus) breeds in the western United States and Central America and the Allen’s hummingbird breeds in the coastal regions of California.</b></p>

            <p><b> <h2>Flamingo</h2> , (order Phoenicopteriformes), any of six species of tall, pink wading birds with thick downturned bills. Flamingos have slender legs, long, graceful necks, large wings, and short tails. They range from about 90 to 150 cm (3 to 5 feet) tall.

                Flamingos are highly gregarious birds. Flocks numbering in the hundreds may be seen in long, curving flight formations and in wading groups along the shore. On some of East Africa’s large lakes, more than a million lesser flamingos (Phoeniconaias minor) gather during the breeding season. In flight, flamingos present a striking and beautiful sight, with legs and neck stretched out straight, looking like white and rosy crosses with black arms. No less interesting is the flock at rest, with their long necks twisted or coiled upon the body in any conceivable position. Flamingos are often seen standing on one leg. Various reasons for this habit have been suggested, such as regulation of body temperature, conservation of energy, or merely to dry out the legs.</b></p>

            <p><b> <h2>Toucans</h2> are also found in South and Central America, southern Mexico and Carribean. They are large birds with distinctive, massive beaks. There are about 40 species of them.</b></p><br>
            <p><b> <h3>Interesting Facts About the Toucan</h3>
                There are so many different and beautiful species of Toucans, Toucanets, and Aracaris. Each one is unique and interesting, so we will highlight some of the most interesting facts about several species below.
                
                Toco Toucan – As we mentioned above, the Toco is the largest species of Toucan in the world. They are also the most well-known of this species of bird. When you picture a Toucan in your head, you probably picture the Toco! It has the largest bill (but not the longest) of all birds, in relation to its body size.
                Choco Toucan – No, this species isn’t the chocolate version of the Toco. The Choco is similar, but less colorful, than its Toco cousin. The name “Choco” is in reference to the forests that these birds inhabit. Choco Toucans live in the Choco rainforests.
                Black-Necked Aracari – This species has black feathers and a bright yellow underbelly. As its name suggests, its throat is black. Midway down its yellow belly, it have a thick stripe of bright red feathers. These starkly contrasting colors are probably where this bird got its nickname, the beautiful Aracari.
                Yellow-Browed Toucanet – This little bird has green feathers and bright yellow “eyebrows” over its eyes. They live only in a tiny patch of rainforest in Peru. Sadly, farmers use this area to grow coca plants, and this habitat destruction is driving the birds to extinction. The IUCN lists this species as Endangered.
                Habitat of the Toucan
                Even though there are many different species of Toucans, they all live in similar types of habitat. Toucans love rainforest, particularly tropical rainforest in warm regions with lots of rainfall. Some species of these birds live only in mountainous regions. Within the rainforest, these birds inhabit the canopy, or the top layer of the tallest trees. They spend most of their lives in the canopy, as they can find all the food they need in the treetops.</b></p>
